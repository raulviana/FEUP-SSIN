## Scenario

An organization intends to design and implement a system with a trusted server supplying services to client
applications, used by their collaborators. The services are REST endpoints that can be called by the client applications. These services have an associated
security level (an integer value). Also, collaborators can send messages to each other using the client application.
The client applications should be mobile, but, for a proof of concept, they can run on a PC with a CLI (command line
interface) or GUI (graphic user interface) interface...[(Full Text)](https://github.com/raulviana/FEUP-SSIN/blob/master/docs/Assign_Sec_2021.pdf)

### Install

    $ npm install

### Create Database

    $ cd database
    $ cat create.sql | sqlite3 Database.db
    or (testing)
    $ cd server
    $ python create_table.py

### Create two clients

    To send messages between two clients run them from different folders
    Pre-registration needed on both

    $ cp -r client ./client2

### Pre-registration & Start Server "face-to-face"

    $ cd server
    $ python register_app.py
    $ node index

### First Registration &/or Authentication (New Session)

    $ cd client
    $ python client.py

- Main Menu
  1. Request service
     1. Calculation of square root (security level: 1)
     2. Calculation of cubic root (security level: 2)
     3. Paramaterized n-root (security level: 3)
  2. Send message
  3. Check received messages

## Encrypt Process

### Registration

---

### Client asks for server public key.

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: public_key

---

---

### Client:

- not encrypted: username
- encrypted (rsa): one_time_id, new_iv, symmetric_key, time

### Server Response:

- encrypted(symmetric): token

---

## Authentication

---

### Client Challenge Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, msg, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: challenge, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): succ_msg

---

### Client Challenge Solved Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): "challenge", time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): new_token, succ_msg

---

## Services

---

### Client set ip Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, ip_port, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): succ_msg

---

---

### Client get ip Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, username_2, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv, ip_port
- encrypted(symmetric): ip_port, succ_msg

---

---

### Client service Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, service_data, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): succ_msg with the value

---

---

### Client set public_key Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, public_key, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): succ_msg

---

---

### Client get public_key Request:

- not encrypted: username, new_iv
- encrypted(symmetric): token, username_2, time

### Server Response:

- not encrypted: new_iv, ip_port
- encrypted(symmetric): public_key, succ_msg
